The following endpoints enable financial institutions to integrate with the **Unified Dispute Management (UDM)** platform, providing seamless access to data for effective dispute management.

## Data Retrieval Considerations

Before initiating data retrieval, clients should evaluate the following approaches for conducting **Authorization** and **Transaction Inquiries**.

## Transaction Inquiry
UDM offers two approaches for conducting **Authorization** and **Transaction Inquiries**:

### Approach 1:
When initiating the **Create Session** request, clients can submit all necessary authorization and transaction data. Upon successful session creation, the client can proceed to the **Questionnaire** endpoint for further processing.

### Approach 2:
Alternatively, clients can provide minimal information, such as PAN, ARN, transaction date, amount, transaction Id, RRN, or custom fields, when initiating the **Create Session**. This triggers the **Transaction Inquiry** endpoint, which automatically retrieves all relevant authorization and transaction data.

<Note> Providing UDM with the most accurate authorization and transaction data from the card network will optimize auto-decisioning and workflow automation.</Note>

## Customization and Workflow Flexibility

Financial institutions can select the most suitable approach based on their existing systems and infrastructure. The modular design of these endpoints allows UDM to execute workflows, automation, and auto-decisioning efficiently. Clients also have the flexibility to request customizations within certain limits, without impacting the platform's core functionality.
The core logic adheres to card network rules, ensuring proper validation of authorization and transaction parameters and seamless integration with the card network interface.
